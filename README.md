# FlattyCraft Plugin Configurations

Welcome to the official FlattyCraft Plugin Configs repository!

This repository serves as a central hub for managing various plugin configurations used on the FlattyCraft server. Our goal is to make it easy for the community to view, understand, and even propose changes to aspects of the server experience, such as shop prices, game mechanics, and more.

## What is this repository for?

FlattyCraft is a dynamic political Minecraft server where player interaction shapes the world. Many aspects of the server, like economic settings or specific plugin behaviors, are determined by configuration files. Instead of us manually updating everything, we're opening up these configurations to the community. This means:

*   **Transparency:** See exactly how different parts of the server are configured.
*   **Community Input:** Easily suggest changes or improvements.
*   **Faster Updates:** Help us implement tweaks and balances more efficiently.

Think of this as a collaborative effort to fine-tune the FlattyCraft experience for everyone!

## How to Contribute

We encourage all FlattyCraft players to get involved! Here's how you can propose changes:

1.  **Fork this Repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this GitHub page. This creates your own editable copy of this repository.
2.  **Navigate to the Configuration File:** Browse through the folders to find the specific plugin configuration file you wish to modify (e.g., `plugins/Essentials/config.yml` for shop prices).
3.  **Edit the File:** Open the file you want to change. You can edit it directly on GitHub by clicking the "pencil" icon, or you can clone your forked repository to your computer and use a text editor.
    *   **Important:** Please only make changes relevant to your proposed idea in a single commit.
    *   **Syntax:** Be careful to maintain the correct syntax of the configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON). Incorrect formatting can break plugins!
4.  **Commit Your Changes:** After making your edits, "commit" them with a clear and concise message explaining what you changed and why. For example: `Feat: Adjust wood prices in shop to prevent inflation` or `Fix: Correct typo in war plugin message`.
5.  **Create a Pull Request:** Once you've committed your changes to your forked repository, go back to the original FlattyCraft Plugin Configs repository on GitHub. You should see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it to open a new Pull Request.
6.  **Describe Your Pull Request:** In the Pull Request description, clearly explain:
    *   **What you changed.**
    *   **Why you changed it.** (e.g., "This change will balance the economy by...", "This fixes a bug where...").
    *   **Any relevant discussions on Discord or in-game.**
7.  **Server Review:** A FlattyCraft staff member will review your proposed changes. We may discuss them with you, suggest modifications, or ask for clarification.
8.  **Merge & Deploy:** Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository and deployed to the server during the next configuration update!

## Finding What You Need

The configurations are organized by plugin. For example:

*   `plugins/Essentials/`: Contains core server settings like economy and basic commands.
*   `plugins/MyTown/`: Settings related to towny or land claiming.
*   `plugins/Shopkeepers/`: Configurations for player shops.
*   ...and so on!

If you're unsure where a specific setting is located, feel free to ask on our Discord server!

## Important Notes

*   **Backup:** While we appreciate your contributions, please understand that submitting a pull request does not guarantee it will be merged. All changes are subject to review and may be modified or rejected.
*   **Testing:** Major changes might be tested on a separate test server before being deployed to the main FlattyCraft server.
*   **Be Respectful:** When discussing changes, please be polite and constructive. We're all working together to make FlattyCraft better!
