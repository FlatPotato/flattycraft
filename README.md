# FlattyCraft Plugin Configurations ✨

Welcome, fellow FlattyCrafters! 🎉 This is the official hub where we manage the beating heart of our server: the plugin configurations!

This repository is designed to be a transparent and collaborative space for all things related to FlattyCraft's shop prices, economic settings, game mechanics, and much more. Think of it as our community's way of tweaking and refining the server experience together! We believe that the best FlattyCraft is a FlattyCraft built *with* its players. So, dive in, explore the configs, and help us make FlattyCraft even more awesome! 💪

## What's Inside? 📂

Here, you'll find the configuration files that dictate how various parts of our FlattyCraft world operate. From how items are priced in shops to the fine details of game mechanics, these files are the blueprints for our server's unique experience. We're starting small, but this space will grow to encompass more as our server evolves! 🗺️

## Want to Suggest a Change? 💡

Got an idea to balance the economy? Spot a typo in a message? Or perhaps a brilliant suggestion to fine-tune a game mechanic? This is the place to make your voice heard! We warmly welcome your contributions and ideas to enhance FlattyCraft for everyone. Just head over to the "Pull Requests" tab to see how you can propose your awesome changes. Your input helps us keep the server fresh, fair, and fun! 🚀
