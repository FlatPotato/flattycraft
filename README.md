# FlattyCraft Plugin Configurations ✨

Welcome, fellow FlattyCrafters! 🎉 This is the official hub where we manage the beating heart of our server: the plugin configurations!

This repository is designed to be a transparent and collaborative space for all things related to FlattyCraft's shop prices, economic settings, game mechanics, and much more. Think of it as our community's way of tweaking and refining the server experience together! We believe that the best FlattyCraft is a FlattyCraft built *with* its players. So, dive in, explore the configs, and help us make FlattyCraft even more awesome! 💪

## What's Inside? 📂

You'll find various plugin configuration files organized by plugin. For example, you can explore:

*   `plugins/Essentials/`: Our core server settings, economy, and basic commands.
*   `plugins/MyTown/`: The intricate details of our towny and land claiming system.
*   `plugins/Shopkeepers/`: All the nitty-gritty for player shops and their pricing.
*   ...and plenty more!

If you're curious about how something works on FlattyCraft, chances are you'll find its blueprint right here! 🗺️
